twinBASIC is a modern version of the classic BASIC programming language.  With twinBASIC we aim for 100% backwards compatibility with existing VB6 and VBA projects.

We aspire to offer a complete replacement development environment for classic BASIC projects whilst also bringing many new features and improvements over the old VB6 IDE and compiler.

#### This is a work-in-progress project.  This repository is for tracking bug reports and feature requests only.
